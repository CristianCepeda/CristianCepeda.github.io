## Background
I'm a Senior at Florida International University and projected to graduate this
upcoming Fall 2018. Spring Semester just ended and I have decided to take on
Front-End Development as a must learn during summer. My goal is to one day
become a Full-Stack Developer, I can attribute this to the fact that I have a
genuine interest and curiosity in how everything comes together and works. So
during this summer break, I will be taking on two projects in hope of realizing
this goal of mine. The first project that I'll be focusing most of my time on
will be my Portfolio Website, and the second project which will extend past
summer is a Web Application where I'll be targeting Real Estate Investors.

## Things I'll be learning
After spending some hours on the Internet trying to find a path so that I can
learn Front-End Development, I have decided to stick with and learn ReactJS. I
also found GatsbyJS which is a framework that complements ReactJS. So with
these two JavaScript libraries/framework, I'll be looking forward to the things
that I'll accomplish this summer. I will update this section if I come across
something new that seems interesting to me or with anything that I use in my
projects.
